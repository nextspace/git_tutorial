What
====
Right here at NextSpace we will get to know git, how it works, what you can do with it,
techniques for distributed development, and cocktail party tricks to impress your friends.

From the [homepage:](http://git-scm.org/)

    Git is a free & open source, distributed version control system designed to handle
    everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

    Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision
    tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. Branching
    and merging are fast and easy to do.

We will cover
-------------
* Installation
* Basic concepts (how it works)
* Branching and Merging
* Distributed Workflows
* How git is better than X (where X is your other favorite version control software)
* Answer questions if I can
